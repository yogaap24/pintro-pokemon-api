# Module Driven Go Todolist

Unlike the so-called 'standard go structure', this project is to show that to
create a software that adheres on onion architecture in go, you don't need to
create a lot of objects and structure.

## Motivation

There are people coming to Go from different backgrounds. The most common people
who want to write Go in my experience they came from these backgrounds:

- Java & Spring Boot
- PHP & Laravel
- Ruby on Rails

They have this popular frameworks with a "canonical file structure" that you
must adhere coming to Go with no 'one true way' and no 'one true frameworks' is
unfamiliar.

When I saw projects on the wild, or when I read the projects from my clients,
there are patterns that I recognised. Most of them are trying to fit Go to their
familiar framework mental models.

So, I'm sick of seeing a convoluted code that tries to shove object orientation
to Go. This is why this project use __mostly functions__.

## The Principles of building this project

This project is not a perfect example of production-grade software. I create
this object with these principle in mind:

- Easy to understand and teach.
- Idiomatic. This means that I use Go like it's intended. Use value as much as
  possible and use patterns like 'accept interface returns value' and avoid
  things like returning interface.
- High cohesion, low coupling. Things that should be together should be in the
  same place.
- Sensible dependencies. I have justification why I use the dependencies.
- Sensible defaults. Every configuration has defaults that make the development easy.

This project is as plain as vanilla. I don't use any ORMs and strive to have
very minimal dependencies. Heck, this project doesn't have any interface
defined. If you see the `go.mod` file, you'll see that these are the dependies
that I use:

```
require (
	github.com/go-chi/chi/v5 v5.0.8
	github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.4.1
	github.com/oklog/ulid/v2 v2.1.0
	github.com/rs/zerolog v1.29.1
	gopkg.in/guregu/null.v4 v4.0.0
	gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1
)
```

I can explain what's the purpose of the dependencies above, and why I chose
those dependencies

1. `go-chi` is a routing library, it helps parses the request parameters and
   route the request. The reason I use this library is because it has zero
   indirect dependencies. Chi is a simple routing library and it does the job
   well.

2. `pgx` is a postgresql client. I don't use standard `database/sql` because
   usually I want the feature of postgresql that's not available on the lowest
   common denominator of database driver.

3. `ulid` is a library to generate and build
   [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec). I need this because I want the primary
   key of the domain is lexicographically sorted but also stateless and unique.

4. `null` is a library that I usually use to avoid `nil` pointer exception and
   avoid to use pointer when I can use a value instead. This dependency is
   optional.

5. `yaml` is a library to parse yaml file. This is also optional dependencies.
   If you don't like YAML you can change it to anything you want.

## How to navigate this project

### `main` package

In the root of this project there's a `main` package that have `main.go`. This
is the place where you put your main program as well as runtime configuration.

### The modules

Within the root project there are _modules_ implemented as Go package. Package
is a boundaries in Go. Everything inside this module is isolated. Inside this
module there's __no rules__ on how you organise files. However, in my project, I
usually have these:

1. __The domain object__. This defines the objects which maintain its state and
   being persisted. In this example it's in the `todo_item.go` file. Within the
   project there's `todo_item_json.go` this is for serialisation only. I prefer
   to separate the json representation on different file.

2. __The repository__. This is an abstraction where you can fetch and save your
   domain objects. I just name it 'repository' because it's _somewhat_ similar
   to repository pattern but I implemented it as with pure functions in
   `repo.go`.

3. __The storage__. This is just a place where you connect, read, and write on
   your repository. In this example, it's very simple, it's just a global `pool`
   object which represent a connection pool to postgresql instance. It's in the
   `db.go`.

4. __The read models__. This is types and structures to represent portion or
   aggregation of data from storage. You __cannot modify__ the read models
   because as name implies, it's for reading.

5. __The service__. This is a file with functions which define a _transaction
   boundary_. This service is agnostic with the protocols. __There should be no
   protocol-related data__ in here such as HTTP Response Code. Also implemented
   in pure functions in `service.go`.

6. __The protocols__. ~~This is a place where you put the handlers to your
   requests. I put it on separate package `handlers` because I don't want to use
   something like `CreateTodoItemHandler` and instead I can just use
   `handlers.CreateTodoItem`. The implication is that if you have many modules
   with the same name `handlers` then you still need to name it. So, you can
   also put a `handlers.go` within the directory, so that you can refer it to
   `todo.CreateItemHandler` and I think that's better than my approach here.~~
   Inside the module there's `routes.go`. Every routes for this module is here.
   This will export `*chi.Mux` object which is implementing `chi.Router`
   interface. This isolates any changes to the subrouter to this module. In
   `main.go` you can just mount the router.

> **Note**
> Previously, most of the functions are exported. On this version, I've made
> functions as private as I can.

Exported functions on each module area as follows:

- `SetPool()` for setting up the global database connection pool.
- `Router()` for exporting the `chi.Mux` object to be mounted.
- The domain object, this is optional. If you want to hide and isolate your
  domain objects, then you can just make it private

## Testing And Faking

I'm rarely uses mocks. Read the rationale
[here](https://joeblu.com/blog/2023_06_mocks/). I do use fake. The good thing
about go it allows build tags which will allow conditional compilation of files.
Because I am using files to demarcate boundaries and responsibilities, this
works well.

Take a look is the `repo.go` and `repo_fake.go` for comparison.

To build or run the program with fake implementation, you can just use `--tags`
parameter, and the fake version will be compiled instead.

```
go build --tags=fake 
```

## Configuration

### Rationale

The early version of this program didn't have configuration file and all
parameters are being hard-coded. At first I think that's enough. However, I
think giving an example of how to implement server who adheres to [12 Factor
App](https://12factor.net/) rules are important.

### Implementation

See `config.go`. This file contains code to parse configuration files from two
sources: environment variables and configuration files. Configuration files
takes precedence. These are the environment variables, configuration file key
path and default value.

| Environment Variable | YAML keypath  | Default value | Description           |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| `KAD_LISTEN_HOST`    | `listen.host` | "127.0.0.1"   | Server Listen Address |
| `KAD_LISTEN_PORT`    | `listen.port` | 8080          | Server Port Address   |
| `KAD_DB_USER`        | `db.user`     | postgres      | Postgres User         |
| `KAD_DB_PASSWORD`    | `db.password` | password      | Postgres Password     |
| `KAD_DB_HOST`        | `db.host`     | "127.0.0.1"   | Postgres Host         |
| `KAD_DB_PORT`        | `db.port`     | 5432          | Postgres Port         |
| `KAD_DB_NAME`        | `db.db_name`  | "todo"        | Database Name         |
| `KAD_DB_SSL`         | `db.ssl_mode` | "disable"     | SSL Mode              |

The default values, if we express it in configuration file is as follows.

```yaml
listen:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080

db:
  user: postgres
  password: password
  db_name: todo
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5432 
  ssl_mode: disable
```

### Configuration file location

The program will search for `config.yaml` on current working directory, or you
can pass `-c` flag to force the program to use your own configuration file name.
For example you can run it using something like this:

```
./mda -c someconfig.yml
```

## Summary

This project is a heuristic, not a guide or a 'framework' of structure. It's to
show that you can have a sensible code structure and architecture by sticking
to the simplicity of Go.
